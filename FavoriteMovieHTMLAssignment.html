<p>
FURY is one of my favorite movies because it places a realistic view on the mortality of the war, and its conflicting tole in human history.
Following a group of men who know death better than most others, the romanticism of most wartime movies is gone and replaced with a brutal
"Kill or be Killed" mentality.

Shia Labeouf does a spectacular job in my opinion in the movie, demonstrating his ability to perform as a rugged and experienced actor. Labeouf
is able to bring to life the process of combat fatigue. Earning the nickname "Bible" based on his devotion to a higher power, there are
many isntances of situational irony, with Bible, being the tanks gunner, taking more lives than the rest.
