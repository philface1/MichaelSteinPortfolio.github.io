		<p>Michael Stein is a lad in his sixteenth year, an avid hiker and photographer who enjoys spending his time in the forests and hills, marshes and seas.
		He has no particular interest in computers but thought, "Hey, this won't be that bad." But nevertheless, it was. Michael also enjoys playing lacrosse 
		and participating in his synagogue. Unlike Connor McCloskey, sitting to his rear and right, Stein actually has a history in offroad racing.</p>
